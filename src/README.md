# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running Application

To Start the application run:

```
npm install
```

Followed by :

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To run tests use the following:

```
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

#### 📝 The Brief:

Make a GET request to the Star Wars "people" end point and for your App component to display the title of the first person that comes back from the API end point (name: 'Luke Skywalker').

#### Star Wars API docs: [https://swapi.dev/]

👉 Create a React app

👉 Make the React app call the Star Wars API people end point and display the first person on the page.

👉 Next, add msw so you can mock (or "stub") the API response.

👉 Use your mock server to write a test to check the first person that your mock server returns is being correctly rendered to the page.
